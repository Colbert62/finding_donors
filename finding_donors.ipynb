    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted.

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: ** \n",
    "\n",
    "- Logistic Regression:\n",
    "    - One application is using logistic regression to estimate the likelihood of certain patients developing health issues based on parameters like blood sugar, weight, etc. \n",
    "    - The model can give you accurate separation of data if the data is separable, and this model gives probabilities of where data could go. It performs best when the data can easily be separated into two parts. \n",
    "    - The weakness of the model are the fact that it may have issues with classifying data into more than 2 classes, and it tends to underfit with large, high-dimensional data. \n",
    "    - The one aspect that may make this a good candidate is the fact we want one of our results to be binary, namely, who is a possible donor and who is not. \n",
    "\n",
    "- SVM\n",
    "\n",
    "    - One real world application of SVM is face recognition. This supervised learning model will scan the image and attempt to place a boundary around the face. \n",
    "    - The strength of the model is that you can use this model for data that doesn't seem to formed in a linear pattern. Rbf parameter chosen, the model tends to work the best. Also, it works better for high- dimensional data. The model does not get as skewed by outliers than other models. \n",
    "    - The weakness are the model tends to take a long time to run. The other downside is figuring out which parameters and kernel are appropiate for your problem. \n",
    "    - For this problem, SVM is a good possible choice,since our data uses large amounts of data and 13 different dimensions. \n",
    "\n",
    "- DecisionTreeClassifier\n",
    "    - One real world application is to understand customer behaviors by gathering data and evaluating who online shops and predicting what are the potential needs of certain customers.\n",
    "    - The strengths of decision tree classifiers are the ability to categroize large quantities data well, they are easy to follow visually, and since they use binary operations to make decisions, it acts like a human. \n",
    "    - The largest weakness with decision tree classifiers is the have a tendency to overfit the training data. Another weakness is that small changes to the data can drasically change the classification, hence making it sensitive to outliers. \n",
    "    - This would be make a good candidate for the donor project because it has a large amount of data, and we want to classify into binary categories: those who are eligible for donations and those who are not. \n",

    "**Answer: ** After looking at the graphs, it appears the Logistic Regression model is the best choice. This is because in the training set, the Decision Tree Classifier overfits and then performs worst in the testing set accuracy and f-scores. For the metrics when the testing set is at 100% of the training data, SVM and Logistic Regression have scores that are similar with an approximate 0.05 difference. In training, the F-score indicates that SVM did better, but the difference is small. Then, for the testing set, Logisitic Regression has the best F-score at around 0.68 with accuracy at around 0.83. We can see when the code was previously running, SVM took the longest to run, while Decision Tree Classifier and Logistic Regression are much faster. As was said in question 2, we see that the best algorithm for the data would be either SVM or Logistic Regression. Since logisitic regression perfroms better in the testing set, I chose the Logistic Regression model."

This model takes the inputs, namely, the independent variables and will create a linear combination with weights to create a probability between 0 and 1 by putting the result of the linear combination through an activation function (usually the log function). During the training, the model would penalize certain attributes more than other using the L1 or L2 to figure out which dimensions have a bigger impact on the outcome. That way, the probabilities will be more accurate, since it takes into account each parameter but weighs them accordingly. Hence, in this case, it will see which parameters may make a person more likely to be a donor and weigh those more heavily than less contributing parameters. \n",

    "- Import [`sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) and [`sklearn.metrics.make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html).\n",
    "- Initialize the classifier you've chosen and store it in `clf`.\n",
    " - Set a `random_state` if one is available to the same state you set before.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary of parameters you wish to tune for the chosen model.\n",
    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",
    "- Perform grid search on the classifier `clf` using the `'scorer'`, and store it in `grid_obj`.\n",
    "- Fit the grid search object to the training data (`X_train`, `y_train`), and store it in `grid_fit`.\n",

    "**Note:** Depending on the algorithm chosen and the parameter list, the following implementation may take some time to run!"

If you are the CEO of a large company, your income will be substantially different than someone who works at a small hardware store.

Hours per week is third because if you work in a job that is high pay may tend to make you work more than the average 40 hours a person works in a week. Race is fourth because in the U.S., the wealthiest individuals tend to be white. Lastly, age is fifth because as you age, you usually have a higher income when you are older."

    "**Answer:** I was correct about age being the fifth most important feature. For hours per week, I was off by one degree of importance. I didn't expect capital- gain and martial status to be as much of importance. Capital gain does make sense, since people who make more money more will expand their portfolio to invest in other ventures. Hence, to have capital gain weight so high makes sense. It would make sense that people who make more tend to married because they tend to be older and because older generations value getting more than the most recent generational groups. Lastly, I was off by one factor for education, but this reaffirms that level of education is a good predictive factor for your income. "

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
